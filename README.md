# PyRex â€“ High-quality corpora from CommonCrawl snapshots

I stopped maintaining my old [texrex](https://github.com/rsling/texrex) web data cleaning software in December 2021. PyRex is a streamlined and cleaned up Python 3 reimplementation of texrex made for analysing CommonCrawl data. The focus i entirely on German. After all, there is THE standard web corpora of English now. It covers all English language on the web, and it's bleeding representative, too!

# First iteration: _One (Always Hardcore)_

*Update 2025* Instead of listing features here, I just admit that what we did 10 to 15 years ago was rather boring and borderline trivial. I'm now working with Claude to very quickly rebuild the functionality of texrex within a few Python script, making heavy use of existing libraries. Since I'm not being paid to do coding, this is the only way there will ever be any new COW corpora again. The critical issues with LLM coding don't really affect some stupid scripts to do HTML cleaning. Honestly, I mean ...

It's certainly less fun, but my idea of fun has changed anyway.
